# Zed Catalog Lens

>[!WARNING]
> I wanted to create a zed extension to accomplish this however after looking deeper into it i dont believe the extension API is robust enough to support the feature

## Local dev setup

To run your extension in Zed as you're developing it:

- Make sure you have Rust installed
- Have the `wasm32-wasip2` target installed (`rustup target add wasm32-wasip2`)
- Open the extensions view using the zed: extensions action in the command palette.
- Click the Install Dev Extension button in the top right
- Choose the path to your extension directory.
